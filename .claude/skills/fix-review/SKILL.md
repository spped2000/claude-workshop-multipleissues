# Fix Review Comments for PR #$0

## Step 1 — Read Review Comments

Read review comments on PR #$0:

```bash
gh pr view $0 --comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$0/comments
```

List each comment with: file path, line number, and what the reviewer requested.

## Step 2 — Fix

Fix each comment exactly as requested.
Do not refactor or change code that was not mentioned in the review.
Do not add new features or tests beyond what reviewers explicitly asked for.
If a comment is unclear, make the minimal reasonable interpretation.

## Step 3 — Verify

Run the full test suite — all tests must pass.
List every file changed and which review comment it addresses.

## Step 4 — Push

Commit with message: `fix: address PR #$0 review comments`
Push to the existing branch — do not open a new PR.
Report the commit SHA when done.
