# Workshop API — Project Context for Claude Code

## Project Overview

FastAPI REST API with in-memory user storage. Python 3.11+.

The API is **intentionally incomplete** — your assigned GitHub issue describes exactly what to add.

## GitHub Workflow — use `gh` CLI

This project uses the **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** instead of the GitHub MCP server.
Each participant authenticates with their own GitHub account via `gh auth login`,
so PR/comment activity shows up under the participant's profile.

### Common commands Claude can run

```bash
# Read your assigned issue
gh issue view <N> --json title,body,labels

# List open issues
gh issue list --state open

# Create a branch and PR
gh pr create --title "..." --body "Closes #<N>"

# Read review comments on a PR
gh pr view <N> --comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<N>/comments
```

`gh` reads auth from the OS keyring — no token env vars needed.

## Your Task

1. Read your assigned issue with `gh issue view <N>`
2. Implement the feature described in the acceptance criteria
3. Write or update tests — all existing tests must continue to pass
4. Open a PR referencing the issue number (e.g. "Closes #1")

## Coding Conventions

- Use `async def` for all route handlers and test functions
- Pydantic v2 models live in `app/models.py`
- In-memory storage only — no database imports, no SQLAlchemy
- Add new routes to `app/routers/users.py` or directly to `app/main.py` (check your issue)
- Tests go in `tests/`, use `pytest-asyncio` with `httpx.AsyncClient`
- Add new dependencies with `uv add <package>` only if your issue explicitly requires one

## Project Structure

```
app/main.py           — FastAPI app, middleware registration, router mount
app/models.py         — All Pydantic request/response models
app/database.py       — In-memory dict storage + helper functions
app/routers/users.py  — User CRUD routes
tests/conftest.py     — Shared fixtures (auto-resets DB between tests)
tests/test_users.py   — Existing CRUD tests
```

## Run Commands

```bash
uv run pytest          # run tests
uv run pytest -v       # verbose
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload  # dev server
uv add <package>       # add new dependency
```

## Test Pattern

```python
async def test_example(client):  # client fixture from conftest.py
    response = await client.get("/some-endpoint")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```
